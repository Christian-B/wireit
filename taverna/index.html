<h1>Taverna KISS Workflow Connector</h1>
Welcome to the Taverna Keep it Simple and Straightforward workflow Connector.
<p>
<a href="taverna.html">Working Example</a>
<p>
This is a prototype designed to show how existing workflows can be connected together and run using Taverna's Command Line tool and later a Taverna server.
<p>
This is NOT a replacement for the Taverna workbench and its Workflow Editor but as a support to to go on top of pre existing workflows.
<p>
It is intended to hide much of the complexity required to build Taverna workflows including:
<ul>
	<li>Hides XML Splitters and Mergers.
	<li>Hides Cross and Dot product choices.
	<li>Hides complex beanshells
	<li>Hides looping
	<li>Avoid users having to decide which paramters are needed for a webservice.
</ul>
What it does do includes:
<ul>
	<li>Allow several workflows to be joined together.
	<ul>
		<li>Even when the output name in one workflow is not the same as the input name as another workflow.
	</ul>
	<li>Provides a simple GUI for running a workflow
</ul>
<h2>Current state/ Limitations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Only workflows where all inputs are depth zero and can take a String input.
	<li>Only workflows which have Depth zero single type output.
	<li>Only predefined workflows
	<ul>
		<li>This is mainly for security
		<li>Additional workflows can easily be added
	</ul>
	<li>Baclava reader fails on some machines
</ul>
<h2>Future work possibly in the scope of the ONDEX protoype</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Allow different input types
	<ul>
		<li>Baclava File
		<li>Value from uri
		<li>Lists
		<ul>
			<li>From uri
			<li>From file
			<li>Typed in
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Allow different output types
	<ul>
		<li>uri to Baclava File
		<li>Baclava file to next workflow
		<li>Any format that can easily be convert to a string
		<li>Lists
	</ul>
	<li>Fix or replace the Baclava reader
	<li>Baclava key (input/ output) name - renamer
	<li>Automatic generation of WireIt module based on Workflow
	<li>Tooltip to describe workflow input and purpose
</ul>
<h2>Future work outside of the ONDEX prototype</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Replace command line with Taverna Server
	<ul>
		<li>Settup issue this includes
		<li>Passing of security stuff from client to server
	</ul>
	<li>Security
	<li>User accounts
	<li>Scuffl 2 workflows
	<li>Taverna 1 workflows
	<li>User documentation
</ul>
